A little about me:
* I'm a freshman in CS at Purdue.
* I love reading books
* I sing
* I also love Marvel movies and Harry Potter

Here's a quote from Harry Potter that I figured would be good advice:
> It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live.

_I hope everyone has an amazing semester! Good Luck!_
