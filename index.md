# Preksha Tharigonda Ravikumar's First CS193 Homework

Favourite things about CS193:
- The lecturers are cool.
- The fact that the USB is looking out for us by wanting to equip us with skills we'll need for college, but no one teaches, is amazing and   I love them for that, especially because I'm a beginner in CS.
- The classes are super fun and informative at the same time.
